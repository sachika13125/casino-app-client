            <p className='font-normal text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-400'><strong>Objective:</strong> The goal of Blackjack is to beat the dealer by having a hand value closer to 21 without going over.</p>
            <ul className='text-left'>
                <li>Each player and the dealer are dealt two cards. The dealer's second card is usually dealt face down (hole card). Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and an Ace can be worth 1 or 11, depending on what benefits the hand.</li>

                <li>Players can choose to "hit" to receive additional cards or "stand" to keep their current hand. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it. Players can continue to hit until they are satisfied with their hand or they exceed 21 (bust).</li>

                <li>Once all players have finished their turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must hit until their hand value is 17 or higher. If the dealer busts, players who haven't bust win.</li>

                <li>The player with a hand value closer to 21 than the dealer wins. If the player's hand value equals the dealer's, it's a "push," and the player's bet is returned. Blackjack is achieved with an Ace and a 10-point card and typically pays out more.</li>
